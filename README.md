angular-bootstrap
=================

A seed project with angular and bootstrap with modular organization for a large project.

I keep creating projects for my own use and wanted a seed project that reflected my file organization. This is how I
would actually organize my projects.

I create a main module file which only contains the module definitions and then create specific folders for directives,
services and controllers. Each module has this whole structure.
